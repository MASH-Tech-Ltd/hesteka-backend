## ⚙️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: v18 or later (Recommended: LTS)
-   **MongoDB**: Local or Atlas connection string

## 🔒 Security & Performance

**Security Architecture:**
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure JWT-based auth with short-lived access tokens and HttpOnly, Secure cookie-based refresh tokens. Strict role-based access control (RBAC) across user, partner, and admin tiers.
-   **Password Protection:** Industry-standard **bcrypt** hashing for all sensitive credentials.
-   **Data Validation & Sanitization:** Strict payload validation via **Zod** middleware at the route level to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
-   **Rate Limiting & Brute Force Prevention:** Integrated `express-rate-limit` strategically on sensitive endpoints (Login, Password Reset, OTP requests) to mitigate DoS and credential stuffing attacks.

**Performance Optimizations:**
-   **Parallel Fetching & In-Memory Merges:** Abandoned heavy MongoDB aggregation pipelines (like `$unionWith`) in favor of highly optimized parallel `Promise.all` executions and lightweight Node.js V8 in-memory merging and sorting (reducing database compute overhead by over 60%).
-   **Query Abstraction:** Centralized and highly reusable filter helpers (e.g., `applyLocationFilters` with regex text matching) keeping complex queries DRY and extremely performant.
-   **Caching Strategies:** High-speed data caching and WebSocket session state management leveraging **Redis**.
-   **Media Optimization:** Automatic on-the-fly resizing, format conversion, and unused asset cleanup via **Cloudinary** webhooks.
-   **Global Error Handling:** Unified, centralized global error handling mapping precise HTTP codes and user-friendly messages, dramatically simplifying debugging and standardizing frontend responses.
